## When and why YQParse is used
For the most time, you don't need to use it. You just go to [Parse.com](https://parse.com/) and download the official Parse iOS SDK. You probably need YQParse, only when you need to build your own static SDK, which requires a backend.

YQParse was first created at [MHacks IV](http://mhacks-iv.challengepost.com/) to support Leaftagger, which was a powerful framework to get feedback from users directly in the native iOS app. It ultimately enables developers to iterate and launch product quicker. So I choose [Parse.com](https://parse.com/) Parse.com and build YQParse.
